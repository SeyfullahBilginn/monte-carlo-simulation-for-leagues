## Development Process

### `Structure: `
At project structure I decided to use mvc pattern. I tried to use component based structure especially for the tables. I didn't use any state management technology because project structure was simple.

### `Technologies Used `

#### `Backend: `
Java, Spring boot

#### `Database: `
MySql

#### `Frontend: `
Javascript, React, Material-ui

##### Note: don't forget to change your mySql password in application.properties before running the project
